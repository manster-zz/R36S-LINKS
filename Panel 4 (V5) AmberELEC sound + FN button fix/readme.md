# Panel 4 (V5) AmberELEC sound + FN button fix

This fixes both, the missing sound and the non-working <kbd>FN</kbd> button (Button 16) on devices with Panel 4 (V5).

Thanks to **KEgg** from Discord for editing and sharing this file!

Just replace the 📄rk3326-rg351mp-linux.dtb with the file above on the 📁AMBRELC partition.

Additional notes from **KEgg**:

> Anyway I've altered that dtb straight away for myself.. and here's an alternate version for all, with the function key enabled.
Keep in mind though, Amberelec is based around start and select and without some further changes to  the system, stand alone emulators and portmaster games, as an example, will still be using start and select to quit... but you'll be able assign the function key in mappings for retroacrh and more.
